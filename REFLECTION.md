1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code.
    - We created a file called App2048 for the 2048 game.
    - We added a constructor that set the game board size to 4x4.
    - We created the print method that allows us to test other methods before adding GUIs.
    - We made the addNewRandom method that finds a random empty space on the game board and
      replaces it with 2 every time it is called.
    - We called the print method in driver to test the other method.
2. **TODO:** Finish reading the project description.
    - We will attempt to complete the 2048 app by the next checkpoint or at least get the GUI part working.
3. **PROB:** We had trouble creating another class for the 2048 game and organizing our project as a whole.
